# THE BLEEDING HOUR (but on Codename Engine!!)
This was tested with experimental builds only as of the moment due to me not really caring about it, however it **SHOULD** work.

But, if you want, they can be downloaded on [Codename Engine's official website](https://codename-engine.com/) under the "Experimental Builds" section (as shown below), just pick the one that matches your platform!

## THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL!! **AT ALL!!**
I'm working on this because I'm bored out of my mind!
